    <h1>Croissant</h1>

    <p>
        A croissant is a delicious French pastry, known by its crescent shape. (Croissant means crescent in French). Puff pastry
        is used to make this delicacy - the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded a few times, then rolled into its
        shape. It is then glazed with butter and baked. It is perfect served warm with some strawberry jam on the side.
